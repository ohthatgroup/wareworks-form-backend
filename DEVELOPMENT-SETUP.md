# ðŸš€ Development Setup Guide

## Quick Start (Fixed Redirect Issue)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd C:\Github\wareworks-form-v2
npm install
cd apps/form-app
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Server
```bash
# From the root directory
npm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js app on `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Test the Webflow Embed Locally

The webflow embed is now configured to automatically detect localhost and use the correct URL:

**For testing the embed:**
1. Open `webflow-embed.html` in a browser
2. The embed will automatically redirect to `http://localhost:3000` when running locally
3. The form will load properly without the redirect error

**Webflow Embed Configuration:**
```javascript
// Auto-detects environment
FORM_APP_URL: window.location.hostname === 'localhost' || window.location.hostname.includes('webflow.io') 
  ? 'http://localhost:3000'  // Development
  : 'https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app'  // Production
```
